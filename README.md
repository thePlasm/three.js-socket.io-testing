# three.js-socket.io-testing
My testing with socket.io and three.js.

## usage
start.bat or sh are what runs the server.<br>
server.js is the actual server code, its first command-line argument is the server port.<br>
To connect to the server, just connect to the server's address in a web browser. (Preferably Chrome or FireFox)

## controls
WASD movement, mouse rotation and click to fire bullets.<br>
Bullet modes: 1: create, 2: destroy, 3: red, 4: green, 5: blue, 6: white, 7: black
